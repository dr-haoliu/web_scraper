Background Liver injury has been documented independently in novel coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir. 
Objective to investigate the drug-induced liver injury associated with 
lopinavir-ritonavir among the patients with COVID-19. Methods We conducted a 
disproportionality analysis of US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event 
Reporting System (FAERS) between 2020Q1 and 2021Q1 to evaluate the association 
between lopinavir-ritonavir and risk of drug-induced liver injury (or severe 
drug-induced liver injury) and calculated their reporting odds ratios (RORs) 
with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results A total of 3,425 cases of 
drug-induced liver injury were reported in 19,782 patients with COVID-19. The 
ROR for drug-induced liver injury was 2.99 (2.59-3.46), 3.16 (2.68-3.73), and 
5.39 (4.63-6.26) when comparing lopinavir-ritonavir with all other drugs, 
hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine only, and remdesivir, respectively. For severe 
drug-induced liver injury, RORs for lopinavir-ritonavir provided evidence of an 
association compared with all other drugs (3.98; 3.15-5.05), compared with 
hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine only (5.33; 4.09-6.94), and compared with 
remdesivir (3.85; 3.03-4.89). Conclusions In the FAERS, we observed a 
disproportional signal for drug-induced liver injury associated with 
lopinavir-ritonavir in patients with COVID-19.
