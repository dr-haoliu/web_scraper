In the current COVID-19 pandemic, evidence to justify the use of any specific 
antiviral drug with proven efficacy is not yet available. Antiviral drug 
development always remains a challenge to the scientists. Remdesivir has emerged 
as a promising molecule, based on results of clinical trials and observational 
studies and has receieved marketing approval for COVID-19 treatment under 
"emergency use authorization" in countries such as United States. Remdesivir is 
a newer antiviral drug that acts as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) 
inhibitor targeting the viral genome replication process. Therapeutic efficacy 
was first demonstrated by suppressing viral replication in Ebola-infected rhesus 
monkeys. It is available for parenteral use with reasonable safety and 
tolerability profile. Multiple clinical trials are going on in many countries to 
evaluate its safety, efficacy and tolerability. Positive outcome will make the 
drug capable of meeting the demand generated by both the current pandemic and 
future outbreak.
