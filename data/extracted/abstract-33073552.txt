OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the data currently 
available regarding the repurposing of different drugs for Covid-19 treatment. 
Participants with suspected or diagnosed Covid-19 will be included. The 
interventions being considered are drugs being repurposed, and comparators will 
include standard of care treatment or placebo.
METHODS: We searched Ovid-MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane library, clinical trial 
registration site in the UK(NIHR), Europe (clinicaltrialsregister.eu), US 
(ClinicalTrials.gov) and internationally (isrctn.com), and reviewed the 
reference lists of articles for eligible articles published up to April 22, 
2020. All studies in English that evaluated the efficacy of the listed drugs 
were included. Cochrane RoB 2.0 and ROBINS-I tool were used to assess study 
quality. This systematic review adheres to the PRISMA guidelines. The protocol 
is available at PROSPERO (CRD42020180915).
RESULTS: From 708 identified studies or clinical trials, 16 studies and 16 case 
reports met our eligibility criteria. Of these, 6 were randomized controlled 
trials (763 patients), 7 cohort studies (321 patients) and 3 case series (191 
patients). Chloroquine (CQ) had a 100% discharge rate compared to 50% with 
lopinavir-ritonavir at day 14, however a trial has recommended against a high 
dosage due to cardiotoxic events. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has shown no 
significant improvement in negative seroconversion rate which is also seen in 
our meta-analysis (p=0.68). Adverse events with HCQ have a significant 
difference compared to the control group (p=0.001). Lopinavir-ritonavir has 
shown no improvement in time to clinical improvement which is seen in our 
meta-analyses (p=0.1). Remdesivir has shown no significant improvement in time 
to clinical improvement but this trial had insufficient power.
DISCUSSION: Due to the paucity in evidence, it is difficult to establish the 
efficacy of these drugs in the treatment of Covid-19 as currently there is no 
significant clinical effectiveness of the repurposed drugs. Further large 
clinical trials are required to achieve more reliable findings. A risk-benefit 
analysis is required on an individual basis to weigh out the potential 
improvement in clinical outcome and viral load reduction compared to the risks 
of the adverse events.
