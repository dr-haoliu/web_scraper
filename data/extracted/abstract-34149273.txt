The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) as a new human 
coronavirus has begun spreading over Wuhan City/China in December 2019, and then 
spread rapidly worldwide, causing pneumonia called COVID-19. Up to now, the 
scientists have extensively attempted to find effective vaccines and drugs for 
treatment of coronavirus infections. To this end, various pharmaceutical agents 
are undergoing the clinical studies to assess their potency and efficacy against 
COVID-19. Based on the new findings, the U.S. food and drug administration (FDA) 
has issued an emergency use authorization for remdesivir as an effective 
anti-viral for remedying the hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Recently, the 
European medicines agency has authorized the use of remdesivir for the treatment 
of COVID-19. Remdesivir as a nucleotide prodrug exhibits broad-spectrum 
antiviral activities against RNA viruses. In this short review, we have rendered 
a brief overview of discovery and synthesis for remdesivir.
