COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory disease caused by a newly discovered 
SARS-CoV-2 virus and identified in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019. 
WHO has declared this disease as a pandemic, and warned other countries. 
Presently this has affected 216 countries, areas or territories worldwide, 
spreading of this disease is very fast in USA, Brazil, and Russia than in the 
country of its origin, China. Like other coronaviruses, this may develop 
respiratory tract infections in the patients range from mild to fatal illness 
like pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). As of now, no 
effective drug, vaccine, or any procedure is available and experiments are 
underway. However, empirical therapy is being followed to manage and save the 
lives of the patients. There is a need for pharmacological alternatives to 
combat this deadly virus and its complications. Based on the previous 
experiences with similar coronavirus management and present preliminary data 
from uncontrolled studies, drugs like chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, 
remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and favipiravir have been recommended by the 
researchers to manage COVID-19. This review had assessed the potential 
mechanisms, safety profile, availability and cost of these drugs. This review 
concludes that the drugs mentioned above are having different properties and act 
differently in combating the COVID-19 viruses. Instead of single drug, 
combination of antivirals with different mechanism of action may be more 
effective and at the same time their adverse events should not be 
underestimated.
