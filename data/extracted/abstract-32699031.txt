Among 2,186 U.S. adults with invasive cancer and laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 
infection, we examined the association of COVID-19 treatments with 30-day 
all-cause mortality and factors associated with treatment. Logistic regression 
with multiple adjustments (e.g., comorbidities, cancer status, baseline COVID-19 
severity) was performed. Hydroxychloroquine with any other drug was associated 
with increased mortality versus treatment with any COVID-19 treatment other than 
hydroxychloroquine or untreated controls; this association was not present with 
hydroxychloroquine alone. Remdesivir had numerically reduced mortality versus 
untreated controls that did not reach statistical significance. Baseline 
COVID-19 severity was strongly associated with receipt of any treatment. Black 
patients were approximately half as likely to receive remdesivir as white 
patients. Although observational studies can be limited by potential unmeasured 
confounding, our findings add to the emerging understanding of patterns of care 
for patients with cancer and COVID-19 and support evaluation of emerging 
treatments through inclusive prospective controlled trials. SIGNIFICANCE: 
Evaluating the potential role of COVID-19 treatments in patients with cancer in 
a large observational study, there was no statistically significant 30-day 
all-cause mortality benefit with hydroxychloroquine or high-dose corticosteroids 
alone or in combination; remdesivir showed potential benefit. Treatment receipt 
reflects clinical decision-making and suggests disparities in medication 
access.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1426.
