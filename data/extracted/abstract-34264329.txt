IMPORTANCE: Randomized clinical trials have yielded conflicting results about 
the effects of remdesivir therapy on survival and length of hospital stay among 
people with COVID-19.
OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between remdesivir treatment and survival and 
length of hospital stay among people hospitalized with COVID-19 in routine care 
settings.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used data 
from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to identify adult patients in 123 
VHA hospitals who had a first hospitalization with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 
from May 1 to October 8, 2020. Propensity score matching of patients initiating 
remdesivir treatment to control patients who had not initiated remdesivir 
treatment by the same hospital day was used to create the analytic cohort.
EXPOSURES: Remdesivir treatment.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Time to death within 30 days of remdesivir treatment 
initiation (or corresponding hospital day for matched control individuals) and 
time to hospital discharge with time to death as a competing event. Associations 
between remdesivir treatment and these outcomes were assessed using Cox 
proportional hazards regression in the matched cohort.
RESULTS: The initial cohort included 5898 patients admitted to 123 hospitals, 
2374 (40.3%) of whom received remdesivir treatment (2238 men [94.3%]; mean [SD] 
age, 67.8 [12.8] years) and 3524 (59.7%) of whom never received remdesivir 
treatment (3302 men [93.7%]; mean [SD] age, 67.0 [14.4] years). After propensity 
score matching, the analysis included 1172 remdesivir recipients and 1172 
controls, for a final matched cohort of 2344 individuals. Remdesivir recipients 
and matched controls were similar with regard to age (mean [SD], 66.6 [14.2] 
years vs 67.5 [14.1] years), sex (1101 men [93.9%] vs 1101 men [93.9%]), 
dexamethasone use (559 [47.7%] vs 559 [47.7%]), admission to the intensive care 
unit (242 [20.7%] vs 234 [19.1%]), and mechanical ventilation use (69 [5.9%] vs 
45 [3.8%]). Standardized differences were less than 10% for all measures. 
Remdesivir treatment was not associated with 30-day mortality (143 remdesivir 
recipients [12.2%] vs 124 controls [10.6%]; log rank P = .26; adjusted hazard 
ratio [HR], 1.06; 95% CI, 0.83-1.36). Results were similar for people receiving 
vs not receiving dexamethasone at remdesivir initiation (dexamethasone 
recipients: adjusted HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.64-1.35; nonrecipients: adjusted HR, 
1.19; 95% CI, 0.84-1.69). Remdesivir recipients had a longer median time to 
hospital discharge compared with matched controls (6 days [interquartile range, 
4-12 days] vs 3 days [interquartile range, 1-7 days]; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of US veterans hospitalized with 
COVID-19, remdesivir treatment was not associated with improved survival but was 
associated with longer hospital stays. Routine use of remdesivir may be 
associated with increased use of hospital beds while not being associated with 
improvements in survival.
