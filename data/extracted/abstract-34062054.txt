BACKGROUND: Initially, persistent asthma was deemed a risk factor for severe 
COVID-19 disease. However, data suggests that asthmatics do not have an 
increased risk of COVID-19 infection or disease. There is a paucity of data 
describing pediatric asthmatics with COVID-19.
OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of 
asthma among hospitalized children with acute symptomatic COVID-19, compare 
demographic and clinical outcomes between asthmatics and nonasthmatics, and 
characterize behaviors of our outpatient pediatric population.
METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective study of pediatric patients 
admitted to the Cohen Children's Medical Center at Northwell Health with 
symptomatic COVID-19 within 4 months of the surge beginning in March 2020 and a 
retrospective analysis of pediatric asthma outpatients seen in the previous 6 
months. Baseline demographic variables and clinical outcomes for inpatients, and 
medication compliance, health behaviors, and asthma control for outpatients were 
collected.
RESULTS: Thirty-eight inpatients and 95 outpatients were included. The inpatient 
prevalence of asthma was 34.2%. Asthmatics were less likely to have abnormal 
chest x-rays (CXRs), require oxygen support, and be treated with remdesivir. 
Among outpatients, 41% reported improved asthma control and decreased rescue 
medication use, with no COVID-19 hospitalizations, despite six suspected 
infections.
CONCLUSIONS: Among children hospitalized for acute symptomatic COVID-19 at our 
institution, 34.2% had a diagnosis of asthma. Asthmatics did not have a more 
severe course and required a lower level of care. Outpatients had improved 
medication compliance and control and a low risk of hospitalization. Biological 
and behavioral factors may have mitigated against severe disease.
