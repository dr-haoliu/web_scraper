Solid organ transplant recipients may be at a high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection 
and poor associated outcomes. We herein report our initial experience with solid 
organ transplant recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection at two centers during the 
first 3 weeks of the outbreak in New York City. Baseline characteristics, 
clinical presentation, antiviral and immunosuppressive management were compared 
between patients with mild/moderate and severe disease (defined as ICU 
admission, intubation or death). Ninety patients were analyzed with a median age 
of 57 years. Forty-six were kidney recipients, 17 lung, 13 liver, 9 heart, and 5 
dual-organ transplants. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (70%), 
cough (59%), and dyspnea (43%). Twenty-two (24%) had mild, 41 (46%) moderate, 
and 27 (30%) severe disease. Among the 68 hospitalized patients, 12% required 
non-rebreather and 35% required intubation. 91% received hydroxychloroquine, 66% 
azithromycin, 3% remdesivir, 21% tocilizumab, and 24% bolus steroids. Sixteen 
patients died (18% overall, 24% of hospitalized, 52% of ICU) and 37 (54%) were 
discharged. In this initial cohort, transplant recipients with COVID-19 appear 
to have more severe outcomes, although testing limitations likely led to 
undercounting of mild/asymptomatic cases. As this outbreak unfolds, COVID-19 has 
the potential to severely impact solid organ transplant recipients.
