The race to find an effective treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
is still on, with only two treatment options currently authorized for emergency 
use and/or recommended for patients hospitalized with severe respiratory 
symptoms: low-dose dexamethasone and remdesivir. The USA decision to stockpile 
the latter has resulted in widespread condemnation and in similar action being 
taken by some other countries. In this commentary we discuss whether stockpiling 
remdesivir is justified in light of the currently available evidence.
