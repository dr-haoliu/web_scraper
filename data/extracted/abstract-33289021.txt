PURPOSE: To determine how hospitals across the United States determined 
allocation criteria for remdesivir, approved in May 2020 for treatment of 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) through an emergency use authorization, 
while maintaining fair and ethical distribution when patient needs exceeded 
supply.
METHODS: A electronic survey inquiring as to how institutions determined 
remdesivir allocation was developed. On June 17, 2020, an invitation with a link 
to the survey was posted on the Vizient Pharmacy Network Community pages and via 
email to the American College of Clinical Pharmacy's Infectious Disease Practice 
and Research Network listserver.
RESULTS: 66 institutions representing 28 states responded to the survey. The 
results showed that 98% of surveyed institutions used a multidisciplinary team 
to develop remdesivir allocation criteria. A majority of those teams included 
clinical pharmacists (indicated by 97% of respondents), adult infectious 
diseases physicians (94%), and/or adult intensivists (69%). Many teams included 
adult hospitalists (49.2%) and/or ethicists (35.4%). Of the surveyed 
institutions, 59% indicated that all patients with COVID-19 were evaluated for 
treatment, and 50% delegated initial patient identification for potential 
remdesivir use to treating physicians. Prioritization of remdesivir allocation 
was often determined on a "first come, first served" basis (47% of respondents), 
according to a patient's respiratory status (28.8%) and/or clinical course 
(24.2%), and/or by random lottery (22.7%). Laboratory parameters (10.6%), 
comorbidities (4.5%), and essential worker status (4.5%) were rarely included in 
allocation criteria; no respondents reported consideration of socioeconomic 
disadvantage or use of a validated scoring system.
CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the inconsistencies of US medical 
centers' methods for allocating a limited pharmacotherapy resource that required 
rapid, fair, ethical and equitable distribution. The medical community, with 
citizen participation, needs to develop systems to continuously reevaluate 
criteria for treatment allocation as additional guidance and data emerge.
