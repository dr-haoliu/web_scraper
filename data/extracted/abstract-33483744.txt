PURPOSE: This report describes our process of 4 health systems coming together 
to agree on standard use criteria for remdesivir as a coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) treatment for patients in Utah. We hope our process provides a 
framework for remdesivir use in other states and insights on future use of other 
therapeutic agents that may also be in short supply, such as vaccines and 
monoclonal antibodies.
SUMMARY: Emergency use authorization (EUA) criteria for COVID-19 treatments 
often allow for broad use of a treatment relative to limited supplies. Without 
national criteria, each health system must develop further rationing criteria. 
Health systems in Utah worked together as part of the state's crisis standards 
of care workgroup to develop a framework for how to limit the EUA criteria for 
remdesivir to match available supplies. The 4 largest health systems were 
represented by infectious diseases specialists, chief medical officers, and 
pharmacists. The group met several times online and communicated via email over 
a 9-day period to develop the criteria. The clinicians agreed to use this 
framework to develop criteria for future therapeutics such as monoclonal 
antibodies.
CONCLUSION: The unique collaboration of the 4 health systems in Utah led to 
statewide criteria for use of remdesivir for patients with COVID-19, ensuring 
similar access to this limited resource for all patients in Utah.
