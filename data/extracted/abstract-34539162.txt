BACKGROUND: Remdesivir treatment, like most antiviral drugs, is likely to be 
most effective when used early in the course of coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19). Optimal timing of remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 remains 
unclear.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine whether early treatment with 
remdesivir improves clinical outcomes: length of stay, need for mechanical 
ventilation, and death.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study of patients 
hospitalized with COVID-19 who received remdesivir therapy within 10 days of 
symptom onset at a large health system in Georgia, United States.
RESULTS: We identified a total of 475 patients. Initiation of therapy 3 days or 
less from first positive SARS-CoV-2 improved length of stay (15.7 days) compared 
with those started on therapy more than 3 days after a positive test (19.3 days) 
(P = 0.03). In the ≤3 day group, further reduction in length of stay was seen in 
those with lower oxygen requirement at baseline (P < 0.0001). Length of stay was 
lower in the ≤3 day group both with and without the use of corticosteroids (P = 
0.0003). The odds of requiring mechanical ventilation were higher for the >3 day 
group compared with the ≤3 day group (odds ratio, 1.5; 95% confidence interval, 
0.8-2.7), and the odds of death were higher for the >3 day group versus the ≤3 
day group (odds ratio, 1.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.9-3.2).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that early treatment with remdesivir in patients 
hospitalized with COVID-19 shortened length of stay.
