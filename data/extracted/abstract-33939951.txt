PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare how treatment with 
convalescent plasma (CP) monotherapy, remdesivir (RDV) monotherapy, and 
combination therapy (CP + RDV) in patients with COVID-19 affected clinical 
outcomes.
METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 infection who were admitted to the hospital 
received CP, RDV, or combination of both. Mortality, discharge disposition, 
hospital length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit (ICU) LOS, and total 
ventilation days were compared between each treatment group and stratified by 
ABO blood group. An exploratory analysis identified risk factors for mortality. 
Adverse effects were also evaluated.
RESULTS: RDV monotherapy showed an increased chance of survival compared to 
combination therapy or CP monotherapy (p = 0.052). There were 15, 3, and 6 
deaths in the CP, RDV, and combination therapy groups, respectively. The 
combination therapy group had the longest median ICU LOS (8, IQR 4.5-15.5, p = 
0.220) and hospital LOS (11, IQR 7-15.5, p = 0.175). Age (p = 0.036), initial 
SOFA score (p = 0.013), and intubation (p = 0.005) were statistically 
significant predictors of mortality. Patients with type O blood had decreased 
ventilation days, ICU LOS, and total LOS. Thirteen treatment-related adverse 
events occurred.
CONCLUSION: No significant differences in clinical outcomes were observed 
between patients treated with RDV, CP, or combination therapy. Elderly patients, 
those with a high initial SOFA score, and those who require intubation are at 
increased risk of mortality associated with COVID-19. Blood type did not affect 
clinical outcomes.
