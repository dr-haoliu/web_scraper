BACKGROUND: Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue prodrug that inhibits viral RNA 
polymerases, has shown in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2.
METHODS: We provided remdesivir on a compassionate-use basis to patients 
hospitalized with Covid-19, the illness caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2. 
Patients were those with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who had an oxygen 
saturation of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or who were 
receiving oxygen support. Patients received a 10-day course of remdesivir, 
consisting of 200 mg administered intravenously on day 1, followed by 100 mg 
daily for the remaining 9 days of treatment. This report is based on data from 
patients who received remdesivir during the period from January 25, 2020, 
through March 7, 2020, and have clinical data for at least 1 subsequent day.
RESULTS: Of the 61 patients who received at least one dose of remdesivir, data 
from 8 could not be analyzed (including 7 patients with no post-treatment data 
and 1 with a dosing error). Of the 53 patients whose data were analyzed, 22 were 
in the United States, 22 in Europe or Canada, and 9 in Japan. At baseline, 30 
patients (57%) were receiving mechanical ventilation and 4 (8%) were receiving 
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. During a median follow-up of 18 days, 36 
patients (68%) had an improvement in oxygen-support class, including 17 of 30 
patients (57%) receiving mechanical ventilation who were extubated. A total of 
25 patients (47%) were discharged, and 7 patients (13%) died; mortality was 18% 
(6 of 34) among patients receiving invasive ventilation and 5% (1 of 19) among 
those not receiving invasive ventilation.
CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients hospitalized for severe Covid-19 who 
were treated with compassionate-use remdesivir, clinical improvement was 
observed in 36 of 53 patients (68%). Measurement of efficacy will require 
ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled trials of remdesivir therapy. (Funded by
