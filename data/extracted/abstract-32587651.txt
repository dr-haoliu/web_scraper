Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) 
has caused significant mortality and has been declared as a global pandemic by 
the World Health Organization. The infection mainly presents as fever, cough, 
and breathing difficulty, and few patients develop very severe symptoms. The 
purpose of this review is to analyze the impact of the virus on the kidney. 
COVID-19 infection causes acute kidney injury (AKI) and is an independent risk 
factor for mortality. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, direct 
viral damage, and immune-mediated damage play important roles in the 
pathogenesis. AKI in COVID-19 infection could be from the synergistic effect of 
virus-induced direct cytotropic effect and cytokine-induced systemic 
inflammatory response. AKI caused in the viral infection has been analyzed from 
the available epidemiological studies. The proportion of patients developing AKI 
is significantly higher when they develop severe disease. Continuous renal 
replacement therapy (CRRT) is the most used blood purification technique when 
needed. The impact of COVID-19 infection on chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 
renal transplant patients is also discussed in the manuscript. No vaccine has 
been developed against the 2019-nCoV virus to date. The critical aspect of 
management is supportive care. Several investigative drugs have been studied, 
drugs approved for other indications have been used, and several clinical trials 
are underway across the globe. Recently remdesivir has received emergency use 
authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA for use in 
patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Prevention of the infection holds the key 
to management. The patients with underlying kidney problems and renal transplant 
patients are vulnerable to developing COVID-19 infection.
