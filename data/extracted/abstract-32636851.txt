Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) represents an 
emergent global threat which is straining worldwide healthcare capacity. As of 
May 27th, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has resulted in more than 
340,000 deaths worldwide, with 100,000 deaths in the US alone. It is imperative 
to study and develop pharmacological treatments suitable for the prevention and 
treatment of COVID-19. Ascorbic acid is a crucial vitamin necessary for the 
correct functioning of the immune system. It plays a role in stress response and 
has shown promising results when administered to the critically ill. Quercetin 
is a well-known flavonoid whose antiviral properties have been investigated in 
numerous studies. There is evidence that vitamin C and quercetin 
co-administration exerts a synergistic antiviral action due to overlapping 
antiviral and immunomodulatory properties and the capacity of ascorbate to 
recycle quercetin, increasing its efficacy. Safe, cheap interventions which have 
a sound biological rationale should be prioritized for experimental use in the 
current context of a global health pandemic. We present the current evidence for 
the use of vitamin C and quercetin both for prophylaxis in high-risk populations 
and for the treatment of COVID-19 patients as an adjunct to promising 
pharmacological agents such as Remdesivir or convalescent plasma.
