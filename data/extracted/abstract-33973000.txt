BACKGROUND: We aimed to describe trends in adverse outcomes among patients who 
tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between February and September 2020 within a 
national healthcare system.
METHODS: We identified enrollees in the national U.S. Veterans Affairs 
healthcare system who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between 2/28/2020 and 
9/30/2020 (n=55,952), with follow-up extending to 11/19/2020. We determined 
trends over time in incidence of the following outcomes that occurred within 30 
days of testing positive: hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, 
mechanical ventilation and death.
RESULTS: Between February and July 2020, there were marked downward trends in 
the 30-day incidence of hospitalization (44.2% to 15.8%), ICU admission (20.3% 
to 5.3%), mechanical ventilation (12.7% to 2.2%), and death (12.5% to 4.4%), 
which subsequently plateaued between July and September 2020. These trends 
persisted after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, comorbid 
conditions, documented symptoms and laboratory tests, including among subgroups 
of patients hospitalized, admitted to the ICU or treated with mechanical 
ventilation. From February to September, there were decreases in the use of 
hydroxychloroquine (56.5% to 0%), azithromycin (48.3% to 16.6%) vasopressors 
(20.6% to 8.7%), and dialysis (11.6% to 3.8%) and increases in the use of 
dexamethasone (3.4% to 53.1%), other corticosteroids (4.9% to 29.0%) and 
remdesivir (1.7% to 45.4%) among hospitalized patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk of adverse outcomes in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients 
decreased markedly between February and July, with subsequent stabilization from 
July to September. These trends were not explained by changes in measured 
baseline patient characteristics and may reflect changing treatment practices or 
viral pathogenicity.
