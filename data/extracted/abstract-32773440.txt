Severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for one of 
the greatest public health challenges of our lifetime, the coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Because of the complicated postinfection sequelae and 
grave consequences, the search for effective therapies has become a worldwide 
priority. The antiviral agent remdesivir has become a viable option and is now 
available in the United States for hospitalized patients through an emergency 
use authorization. This article describes remdesivir's historical background, 
pharmacology, key trials, adverse events, and issues regarding accessibility.
