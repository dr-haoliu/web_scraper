INTRODUCTION: There were no formal regulatory approvals for antivirals for the 
COVID-19 pandemic as of June 2020.
AREAS COVERED: We compare the first regulatory approvals for remdesivir, through 
emergency pathways available to three of the main regulators in the world, the 
U.S., Japan, and the EU. We look at the data supporting the decisions and how 
authorities exchanged information and collaborated to speed up approvals. Based 
only on topline data available as of 29 April 2020, regulators granted approvals 
to remdesivir based on very limited but robust data and waiting for more safety 
and efficacy data. This included the Emergency Use Authorization in the U.S. on 
1 May, the Special Approval for Emergency in Japan on 7 May, and Compassionate 
Use (3 April) followed by a Conditional Marketing Authorization in Europe 
(Opinion 25th June, Decision (3 July)).
EXPERT OPINION: While the regulatory approvals were clearly based on evidence, 
regulators used agile methods to speed up approval, and make the first antiviral 
with reliable data available to patients in their constituencies in a very short 
time frame. More data and wider patient access are still necessary for this 
product, and more treatments are needed for patients affected by COVID-19.
