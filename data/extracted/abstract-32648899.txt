IMPORTANCE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, due to the novel 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused a 
worldwide sudden and substantial increase in hospitalizations for pneumonia with 
multiorgan disease. This review discusses current evidence regarding the 
pathophysiology, transmission, diagnosis, and management of COVID-19.
OBSERVATIONS: SARS-CoV-2 is spread primarily via respiratory droplets during 
close face-to-face contact. Infection can be spread by asymptomatic, 
presymptomatic, and symptomatic carriers. The average time from exposure to 
symptom onset is 5 days, and 97.5% of people who develop symptoms do so within 
11.5 days. The most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, and shortness of 
breath. Radiographic and laboratory abnormalities, such as lymphopenia and 
elevated lactate dehydrogenase, are common, but nonspecific. Diagnosis is made 
by detection of SARS-CoV-2 via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
testing, although false-negative test results may occur in up to 20% to 67% of 
patients; however, this is dependent on the quality and timing of testing. 
Manifestations of COVID-19 include asymptomatic carriers and fulminant disease 
characterized by sepsis and acute respiratory failure. Approximately 5% of 
patients with COVID-19, and 20% of those hospitalized, experience severe 
symptoms necessitating intensive care. More than 75% of patients hospitalized 
with COVID-19 require supplemental oxygen. Treatment for individuals with 
COVID-19 includes best practices for supportive management of acute hypoxic 
respiratory failure. Emerging data indicate that dexamethasone therapy reduces 
28-day mortality in patients requiring supplemental oxygen compared with usual 
care (21.6% vs 24.6%; age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.74-0.92]) and 
that remdesivir improves time to recovery (hospital discharge or no supplemental 
oxygen requirement) from 15 to 11 days. In a randomized trial of 103 patients 
with COVID-19, convalescent plasma did not shorten time to recovery. Ongoing 
trials are testing antiviral therapies, immune modulators, and anticoagulants. 
The case-fatality rate for COVID-19 varies markedly by age, ranging from 0.3 
deaths per 1000 cases among patients aged 5 to 17 years to 304.9 deaths per 1000 
cases among patients aged 85 years or older in the US. Among patients 
hospitalized in the intensive care unit, the case fatality is up to 40%. At 
least 120 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are under development. Until an effective vaccine 
is available, the primary methods to reduce spread are face masks, social 
distancing, and contact tracing. Monoclonal antibodies and hyperimmune globulin 
may provide additional preventive strategies.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: As of July 1, 2020, more than 10 million people 
worldwide had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Many aspects of transmission, 
infection, and treatment remain unclear. Advances in prevention and effective 
management of COVID-19 will require basic and clinical investigation and public 
health and clinical interventions.
