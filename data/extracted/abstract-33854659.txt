BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality has waned 
significantly over time; however, factors contributing towards this reduction 
largely remain unidentified. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the trend 
in mortality at our large tertiary academic health system and factors 
contributing to this trend.
METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of intensive care unit (ICU) 
patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between March and August 2020 admitted across 
14 hospitals in the Philadelphia area. Collected data included demographics, 
comorbidities, admission risk of mortality score, laboratory values, medical 
interventions, survival outcomes, hospital and ICU length of stay (LOS) and 
discharge disposition. Chi-square (Ï‡2) test, Fisher exact test, 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method, multinomial logistic regression models, 
independent sample t-test, Mann-Whitney U test and one-way analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) were used.
RESULTS: A total of 1,204 patients were included. Overall mortality was 39%. 
Mortality declined significantly from 46% in March to 14% in August 2020 (P < 
0.05). The most common underlying comorbidities were hypertension (60.2%), 
diabetes mellitus (44.7%), dyslipidemia (31.6%) and congestive heart failure 
(14.7%). Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) use was more commonly associated with the 
patients who died, while the use of remdesivir, tocilizumab, steroids and 
duration of these medications were not significantly different. Peak values of 
ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer 
levels were significantly higher in patients who died (P < 0.05). The mean 
hospital LOS was significantly longer in the patients who survived compared to 
the patients who died (18 vs. 12, P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The mortality of patients admitted to our ICU system significantly 
decreased over time. Factors that may have contributed to this may be the result 
of a better understanding of COVID-19 pathophysiology and treatments. Further 
research is needed to elucidate the factors contributing to a reduction in the 
mortality rate for this patient population.
