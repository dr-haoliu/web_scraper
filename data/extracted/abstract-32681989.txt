OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical manifestations and outcomes of critically 
ill children with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in New York City.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational study of children 1 month to 21 years 
admitted March 14 to May 2, 2020, to 9 New York City pediatric intensive care 
units (PICUs) with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.
RESULTS: Of 70 children admitted to PICUs, median age was 15 (IQR 9, 19) years; 
61.4% male; 38.6% Hispanic; 32.9% black; and 74.3% with comorbidities. Fever 
(72.9%) and cough (71.4%) were the common presenting symptoms. Twelve patients 
(17%) met severe sepsis criteria; 14 (20%) required vasopressor support; 21 
(30%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); 9 (12.9%) met acute 
kidney injury criteria; 1 (1.4%) required renal-replacement therapy, and 2 
(2.8%) had cardiac arrest. For treatment, 27 (38.6%) patients received 
hydroxychloroquine; 13 (18.6%) remdesivir; 23 (32.9%) corticosteroids; 3 (4.3%) 
tocilizumab; and 1 (1.4%) anakinra; no patient was given immunoglobulin or 
convalescent plasma. Forty-nine (70%) patients required respiratory support: 14 
(20.0%) noninvasive mechanical ventilation, 20 (28.6%) invasive mechanical 
ventilation (IMV), 7 (10%) prone position, 2 (2.8%) inhaled nitric oxide, and 1 
(1.4%) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Nine (45%) of the 20 patients 
requiring IMV were extubated by day 14 with median IMV duration of 218 (IQR 79, 
310.4) hours. Presence of ARDS was significantly associated with duration of 
PICU and hospital stay, and lower probability of PICU and hospital discharge at 
hospital day 14 (P < .05 for all).
CONCLUSIONS: Critically ill children with COVID-19 predominantly are 
adolescents, have comorbidities, and require some form of respiratory support. 
The presence of ARDS is significantly associated with prolonged PICU and 
hospital stay.
