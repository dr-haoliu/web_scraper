OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical profiles and risk factors for critical 
illness in hospitalized children and adolescents with coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19).
STUDY DESIGN: Children 1 month to 21 years of age with COVID-19 from a single 
tertiary care children's hospital between March 15 and April 13, 2020 were 
included. Demographic and clinical data were collected.
RESULTS: In total, 67 children tested positive for COVID-19; 21 (31.3%) were 
managed as outpatients. Of 46 admitted patients, 33 (72%) were admitted to the 
general pediatric medical unit and 13 (28%) to the pediatric intensive care unit 
(PICU). Obesity and asthma were highly prevalent but not significantly 
associated with PICU admission (P = .99). Admission to the PICU was 
significantly associated with higher C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and 
pro-B type natriuretic peptide levels and platelet counts (P < .05 for all). 
Patients in the PICU were more likely to require high-flow nasal cannula 
(P = .0001) and were more likely to have received Remdesivir through 
compassionate release (P < .05). Severe sepsis and septic shock syndromes were 
observed in 7 (53.8%) patients in the PICU. Acute respiratory distress syndrome 
was observed in 10 (77%) PICU patients, 6 of whom (46.2%) required invasive 
mechanical ventilation for a median of 9 days. Of the 13 patients in the PICU, 8 
(61.5%) were discharged home, and 4 (30.7%) patients remain hospitalized on 
ventilatory support at day 14. One patient died after withdrawal of 
life-sustaining therapy because of metastatic cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: We describe a higher than previously recognized rate of severe 
disease requiring PICU admission in pediatric patients admitted to the hospital 
with COVID-19.
