KEY POINTS: In a multicenter point-prevalence study, we found that the rate of 
supportive care was high; among those receiving COVID-19 drug therapies, adverse 
reactions occurred in 12% of patients.
PURPOSE: There are currently no FDA-approved medications for the treatment of 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). At the onset of the pandemic, off-label 
medication use was supported by limited or no clinical data. We sought to 
characterize experimental COVID-19 therapies and identify safety signals during 
this period.
METHODS: We conducted a noninterventional, multicenter, point prevalence study 
of patients hospitalized with suspected/confirmed COVID-19. Clinical and 
treatment characteristics within a 24-hour window were evaluated in a random 
sample of up to 30 patients per site. The primary objective was to describe 
COVID-19-targeted therapies. The secondary objective was to describe adverse 
drug reactions (ADRs).
RESULTS: A total of 352 patients treated for COVID-19 at 15 US hospitals From 
April 18 to May 8, 2020, were included in the study. Most patients were treated 
at academic medical centers (53.4%) or community hospitals (42.6%). Sixty-seven 
patients (19%) were receiving drug therapy in addition to supportive care. Drug 
therapies used included hydroxychloroquine (69%), remdesivir (10%), and 
interleukin-6 antagonists (9%). Five patients (7.5%) were receiving combination 
therapy. The rate of use of COVID-19-directed drug therapy was higher in 
patients with vs patients without a history of asthma (14.9% vs 7%, P = 0.037) 
and in patients enrolled in clinical trials (26.9% vs 3.2%, P < 0.001). Among 
those receiving drug therapy, 8 patients (12%) experienced an ADR, and ADRs were 
recognized at a higher rate in patients enrolled in clinical trials (62.5% vs 
22%; odds ratio, 5.9; P = 0.028).
CONCLUSION: While we observed high rates of supportive care for patients with 
COVID-19, we also found that ADRs were common among patients receiving drug 
therapy, including those enrolled in clinical trials. Comprehensive systems are 
needed to identify and mitigate ADRs associated with experimental COVID-19 
treatments.
