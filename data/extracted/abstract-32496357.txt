BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
2 [coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] poses unique challenges for 
immunosuppressed patients. Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients comprise a 
large proportion of this group, yet there is limited knowledge about the 
presentation, clinical course, and immunosuppression management of this novel 
infection among heart, lung, liver, pancreas, and kidney transplant recipients.
METHODS: We present 21 SOT recipients diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 1, 
2020 and April 22, 2020 at a US high-volume transplant center. Diagnostic 
workup, clinical course, immunosuppression/antiviral management, and immediate 
outcomes are described.
RESULTS: Twenty-one (15.9%) of 132 symptomatic patients tested were positive. 
Mean age at diagnosis was 54.8 ± 10.9 y. Median time from transplant was 5.58 y 
(interquartile range 2.25, 7.33). Median follow-up was 18 d (interquartile range 
13, 30). Fourteen patients required inpatient management, with 7 (50%) placed in 
the intensive care unit (ICU). All transplant types were represented. Nearly 43% 
exhibited GI symptoms. Over half (56.2%) presented with elevated serum 
creatinine suggestive of acute kidney injury. The majority of patients (5/7) 
with concomitant infections at baseline required the ICU. Eighty percent 
received hydroxychloroquine ± azithromycin. Ten received toclizumab and/or 
ribavirin; 1 received remdesivir. Antimetabolites ± calcineurin inhibitors were 
held or reduced. Over half of hospitalized patients (8/14) were discharged home. 
Only 1 mortality (4.8%) to date, in a critically ill heart/kidney patient who 
had been in the ICU before diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 positive SOT at our institution had favorable short-term 
outcomes. Those with concomitant infections had more severe illness. More data 
will be available to evaluate long-term outcomes and disease impact on graft 
function.
