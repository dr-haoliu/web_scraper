BACKGROUND: Transplant recipients with HIV may have worse outcomes with 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to impaired T-cell function coupled with 
immunosuppressive drugs. Alternatively, immunosuppression might reduce 
inflammatory complications and/or antiretrovirals could be protective.
METHODS: Prospective reporting of all cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection was required 
within the HOPE in Action Multicenter Consortium, a cohort of kidney and liver 
transplant recipients with HIV who have received organs from donors with and 
without HIV at 32 transplant centers in the United States.
RESULTS: Between March 20, 2020 and September 25, 2020, there were 11 COVID-19 
cases among 291 kidney and liver recipients with HIV (4%). In those with 
COVID-19, median age was 59 y, 10 were male, 8 were kidney recipients, and 5 had 
donors with HIV. A higher proportion of recipients with COVID-19 compared with 
the overall HOPE in the Action cohort were Hispanic (55% versus 12%) and 
received transplants in New York City (73% versus 34%, P < 0.05). Most (10/11, 
91%) were hospitalized. High-level oxygen support was required in 7 and 
intensive care in 5; 1 participant opted for palliative care instead of transfer 
to the intensive care unit. HIV RNA was undetectable in all. Median absolute 
lymphocyte count was 0.3 × 103 cells/μL. Median CD4 pre-COVID-19 was 298 
cells/μL, declining to <200 cells/μl in 6/7 with measurements on admission. 
Treatment included high-dose steroids (n = 6), tocilizumab (n = 3), remdesivir 
(n = 2), and convalescent plasma (n = 2). Four patients (36%) died.
CONCLUSIONS: Within a national prospective cohort of kidney and liver transplant 
recipients with HIV, we report high mortality from COVID-19.
