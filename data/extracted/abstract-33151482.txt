BACKGROUND: Treatment decisions for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) depend 
on disease severity, but the prescribing pattern by severity and drivers of 
therapeutic choices remain unclear.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study were to evaluate pharmacological 
treatment patterns by COVID-19 severity and identify the determinants of 
prescribing for COVID-19.
METHODS: Using electronic health record data from a large Massachusetts-based 
healthcare system, we identified all patients aged ≥ 18 years hospitalized with 
laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 1 March to 24 May, 2020. We defined five 
levels of COVID-19 severity at hospital admission: (1) hospitalized but not 
requiring supplemental oxygen; (2-4) hospitalized and requiring oxygen ≤ 2, 3-4, 
and ≥ 5 L per minute, respectively; and (5) intubated or admitted to an 
intensive care unit. We assessed the medications used to treat COVID-19 or as 
supportive care during hospitalization.
RESULTS: Among 2821 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, we found inpatient 
mortality increased by severity from 5% for level 1 to 23% for level 5. As 
compared to patients with severity level 1, those with severity level 5 were 
3.53 times (95% confidence interval 2.73-4.57) more likely to receive a 
medication used to treat COVID-19. Other predictors of treatment were fever, low 
oxygen saturation, presence of co-morbidities, and elevated inflammatory 
biomarkers. The use of most COVID-19 relevant medications has dropped 
substantially while the use of remdesivir and therapeutic anticoagulants has 
increased over the study period.
CONCLUSIONS: Careful consideration of disease severity and other determinants of 
COVID-19 drug use is necessary for appropriate conduct and interpretation of 
non-randomized studies evaluating outcomes of COVID-19 treatments.
