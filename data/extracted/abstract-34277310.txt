BACKGROUND: Currently, the management of SARS-CoV-2 varies with no definitive 
clinical guidelines, as scientific evidence across the globe differs in 
therapeutic options. This study intended to provide some clarity to the 
insufficient data based on the role of monotherapy with tocilizumab (TCZ) and 
combination therapy with remdesivir (RDV) and TCZ among patients with SARS-CoV-2 
infection in El Paso, Texas. We evaluated the use of each therapy in the 
presence of steroids as the standard of care.
METHODS:  One hundred and fifty-four SARS-CoV-2-infected patients from four 
different medical centers in El Paso, Texas, were screened, with 113 eligible 
for this longitudinal comparative observational study (February 1, 2020 to 
October 31, 2020). Group 1 (80 patients) received TCZ in the first 24 hours 
following admission, then methylprednisolone for the next 72 hours and group 2 
(33 patients) were given TCZ as detailed in the single therapy group, plus RDV 
within the first 24 hours. Mann Whitney U test assessed median differences in 
laboratory biomarkers and Bivariate Logistic Regression assessed the odds of 
risk. An observation is considered statistically significant when P-value is 
≤0.05.
RESULTS: Patients in group 1 had a statistically significant lower odds for 
ventilation use than group 2 (OR=0.34, 95%CI=0.12-0.95, p=0.034), although no 
statistically significant difference in mortality outcomes was observed across 
groups (OR=0.43, 95%CI:0.13-1.39, p=0.269).
CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the use of TCZ in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients in 
El Paso, with or without RDV, reported no mortality benefit. However, some 
minimal/non-use of ventilation benefit was observed in group 1. Nonetheless, a 
randomized controlled trial study is recommended to ultimately determine the 
combination role of TCZ and RDV among this highly vulnerable group of patients.
