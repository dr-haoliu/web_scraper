OBJECTIVES: We sought to describe the presentation, course, and outcomes of 
hospitalized pediatric coronavirus disease 2019 patients, with detailed 
description of those requiring mechanical ventilation, and comparisons between 
critically ill and noncritical hospitalized pediatric patients.
DESIGN: Observational cohort study.
SETTING: Riley Hospital for Children at Indiana University Health in 
Indianapolis in the early weeks of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.
PATIENTS: All hospitalized pediatric patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 
2019 as of May 4, 2020, were included.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients received therapies including hydroxychloroquine, 
remdesivir, tocilizumab, and convalescent serum and were managed according to an 
institutional algorithm based on evidence available at the time of presentation.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 407 children tested for severe acute 
respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 at our hospital, 24 were positive, and 19 
required hospitalization. Seven (36.8%) were critically ill in ICU, and four 
(21%) required mechanical ventilation. Hospitalized children were predominantly 
male (14, 74%) and African-American or Hispanic (14, 74%), with a bimodal 
distribution of ages among young children less than or equal to 2 years old (8, 
42%) and older adolescents ages 15-18 (6, 32%). Five of seven (71.4%) of 
critically ill patients were African-American (n = 3) or Hispanic (n = 2). 
Critical illness was associated with older age (p = 0.017), longer duration of 
symptoms (p = 0.036), and lower oxygen saturation on presentation (p = 0.016); 
with more thrombocytopenia (p = 0.015); higher C-reactive protein (p = 0.031); 
and lower WBC count (p = 0.039). Duration of mechanical ventilation averaged 
14.1 days. One patient died.
CONCLUSIONS: Severe, protracted coronavirus disease 2019 is seen in pediatric 
patients, including those without significant comorbidities. We observed a 
greater proportion of hospitalized children requiring mechanical ventilation 
than has been reported to date. Older children, African-American or Hispanic 
children, and males may be at risk for severe coronavirus disease 2019 requiring 
hospitalization. Hypoxia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated C-reactive protein may 
be useful markers of critical illness. Data regarding optimal management and 
therapies for pediatric coronavirus disease 2019 are urgently needed.
