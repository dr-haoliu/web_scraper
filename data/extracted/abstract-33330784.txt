The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a serious threat to global 
public health and economies. Currently, hundreds of clinical trials on a wide 
variety of treatments against COVID-19 are being conducted around the world. 
Here, we conducted a search for ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of 
COVID-19 at the clinicaltrials.gov database on April 2, 2020. In total, 48 
clinical trials were identified, and of these, 41 trials adopted drug 
intervention and the other 7 trials utilized biological intervention. The number 
of trials stratified by a chief country conducting the investigation were 18 in 
China, 5 in the United States, 4 in Canada, 3 in Italy, 2 in France and Brazil, 
and 4 trials are being performed multinationally. The drugs utilized in more 
than one trials were remdesivir (6 trials), lopinavir/ritonavir (6 trials), 
hydroxychloroquine (6 trials), interferon (5 trials), methylprednisolone (3 
trials), nitric oxide gas (3 trials), oseltamivir (2 trials), arbidol (2 
trials), and vitamin C (2 trials). We also described the Japanese trials which 
are now being conducted or scheduled, utilizing lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, 
favipiravir, ciclesonide and nafamostat.
