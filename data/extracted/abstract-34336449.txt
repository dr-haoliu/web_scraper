Background Currently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) serology is recommended only for seroprevalence. We think it could 
be useful in differentiating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) stages, which 
could in terms of helping improve our therapeutic interventions. Methods The 
medical records of adult patients admitted to the hospital with probable 
COVID-19 were extracted and analyzed. We excluded patients with no serology and 
no clear outcome at the end of data collection. Patient demographics, medical 
history, and biochemical and clinical data were retrieved. Results A total of 
202 patients were included; 57% were males, the majority were Hispanic (45%), 
followed by African Americans (22%). Hypertension is the most common 
comorbidity, followed by diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. We 
classified them into three groups based on their serology: subacute stage (47 
patients) with both immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG negative; acute stage (116 
patients) with IgM positive and late-stage (39 patients) with IgM negative and 
IgG positive. We found that elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ferritin 
were present in the IgM+ and IgM-/IgG+ subgroups (p-value of 0.0061 and p-value 
0.0013, respectively) while C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer were more 
elevated in the IgM-/IgG- and IgM+ subgroups (P <0.0001 and p-value of 0.0452, 
respectively). The IgM+ group had the worst prognosis, with high mortality 
despite receiving remdesivir and dexamethasone. Conclusion Our findings suggest 
that the use of serology in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 could predict 
prognosis; this will need to be validated in a larger prospective study.
