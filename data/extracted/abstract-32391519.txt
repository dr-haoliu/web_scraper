BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has had an impact on 
healthcare systems around the world with 3 million people contracting the 
disease and 208,000 cases resulting in death as of this writing. Information 
regarding coronavirus infection in pregnancy is still limited.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the clinical course of severe and 
critical coronavirus disease 2019 in hospitalized pregnant women with positive 
laboratory testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.
STUDY DESIGN: This is a cohort study of pregnant women with severe or critical 
coronavirus disease 2019 hospitalized at 12 US institutions between March 5, 
2020, and April 20, 2020. Severe disease was defined according to published 
criteria as patient-reported dyspnea, respiratory rate >30 per minute, blood 
oxygen saturation ≤93% on room air, ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen 
to the fraction of inspired oxygen <300 mm Hg, or lung infiltrates >50% within 
24-48 hours on chest imaging. Critical disease was defined as respiratory 
failure, septic shock, or multiple organ dysfunction or failure. Women were 
excluded from the study if they had presumed coronavirus disease 2019, but 
laboratory testing was negative. The primary outcome was median duration from 
hospital admission to discharge. Secondary outcomes included need for 
supplemental oxygen, intubation, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, death, and 
timing of delivery. The clinical courses are described by the median disease day 
on which these outcomes occurred after the onset of symptoms. Treatment and 
neonatal outcomes are also reported.
RESULTS: Of 64 hospitalized pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019, 44 
(69%) had severe disease, and 20 (31%) had critical disease. The following 
preexisting comorbidities were observed: 25% had a pulmonary condition, 17% had 
cardiac disease, and the mean body mass index was 34 kg/m2. Gestational age was 
at a mean of 29±6 weeks at symptom onset and a mean of 30±6 weeks at hospital 
admission, with a median disease day 7 since first symptoms. Most women (81%) 
were treated with hydroxychloroquine; 7% of women with severe disease and 65% of 
women with critical disease received remdesivir. All women with critical disease 
received either prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation during their 
admission. The median duration of hospital stay was 6 days (6 days [severe 
group] and 10.5 days [critical group]; P=.01). Intubation was usually performed 
around day 9 on patients who required it, and peak respiratory support for women 
with severe disease was performed on day 8. In women with critical disease, 
prone positioning was required in 20% of cases, the rate of acute respiratory 
distress syndrome was 70%, and reintubation was necessary in 20%. There was 1 
case of maternal cardiac arrest, but there were no cases of cardiomyopathy or 
maternal death. Thirty-two of 64 (50%) women with coronavirus disease 2019 in 
this cohort delivered during their hospitalization (34% [severe group] and 85% 
[critical group]). Furthermore, 15 of 17 (88%) pregnant women with critical 
coronavirus disease 2019 delivered preterm during their disease course, with 16 
of 17 (94%) pregnant women giving birth through cesarean delivery; overall, 15 
of 20 (75%) women with critical disease delivered preterm. There were no 
stillbirths or neonatal deaths or cases of vertical transmission.
CONCLUSION: In pregnant women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019, 
admission into the hospital typically occurred about 7 days after symptom onset, 
and the duration of hospitalization was 6 days (6 [severe group] vs 12 [critical 
group]). Women with critical disease had a high rate of acute respiratory 
distress syndrome, and there was 1 case of cardiac arrest, but there were no 
cases of cardiomyopathy or maternal mortality. Hospitalization of pregnant women 
with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 resulted in delivery during the 
clinical course of the disease in 50% of this cohort, usually in the third 
trimester. There were no perinatal deaths in this cohort.
