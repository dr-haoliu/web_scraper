BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has exposed 
longstanding racial and ethnic inequities in health risks and outcomes in the 
United States. We aimed to identify racial and ethnic differences in 
presentation and outcomes for patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
METHODS: The American Heart Association COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease Registry 
is a retrospective observational registry capturing consecutive patients 
hospitalized with COVID-19. We present data on the first 7868 patients by 
race/ethnicity treated at 88 hospitals across the United States between January 
17, 2020, and July 22, 2020. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. 
Secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (death, 
myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure) and COVID-19 cardiorespiratory 
ordinal severity score (worst to best: death, cardiac arrest, mechanical 
ventilation with mechanical circulatory support, mechanical ventilation with 
vasopressors/inotrope support, mechanical ventilation without hemodynamic 
support, and hospitalization alone. Multivariable logistic regression analyses 
were performed to assess the relationship between race/ethnicity and each 
outcome adjusting for differences in sociodemographic, clinical, and 
presentation features, and accounting for clustering by hospital.
RESULTS: Among 7868 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 33.0% were Hispanic, 
25.5% were non-Hispanic Black, 6.3% were Asian, and 35.2% were non-Hispanic 
White. Hispanic and Black patients were younger than non-Hispanic White and 
Asian patients and were more likely to be uninsured. Black patients had the 
highest prevalence of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. Black patients also 
had the highest rates of mechanical ventilation (23.2%) and renal replacement 
therapy (6.6%) but the lowest rates of remdesivir use (6.1%). Overall mortality 
was 18.4% with 53% of all deaths occurring in Black and Hispanic patients. The 
adjusted odds ratios for mortality were 0.93 (95% CI, 0.76-1.14) for Black 
patients, 0.90 (95% CI, 0.73-1.11) for Hispanic patients, and 1.31 (95% CI, 
0.96-1.80) for Asian patients compared with non-Hispanic White patients. The 
median odds ratio across hospitals was 1.99 (95% CI, 1.74-2.48). Results were 
similar for major adverse cardiovascular events. Asian patients had the highest 
COVID-19 cardiorespiratory severity at presentation (adjusted odds ratio, 1.48 
[95% CI, 1.16-1.90]).
CONCLUSIONS: Although in-hospital mortality and major adverse cardiovascular 
events did not differ by race/ethnicity after adjustment, Black and Hispanic 
patients bore a greater burden of mortality and morbidity because of their 
disproportionate representation among COVID-19 hospitalizations.
