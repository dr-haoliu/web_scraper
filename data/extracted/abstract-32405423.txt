INTRODUCTION: 'Repurposing' existing drugs to treat COVID-19 is vital to 
reducing mortality and controlling the pandemic. Several promising drugs have 
been identified and are in various stages of clinical trials globally. If 
efficacy of these drugs is demonstrated, rapid, mass availability at an 
affordable cost would be essential to ensuring equity and access especially 
amongst low- and middle-income economies.
METHODS: Minimum costs of production were estimated from the costs of active 
pharmaceutical ingredients using established methodology, which had good 
predictive accuracy for medicines for hepatitis C and HIV amongst others. Data 
were extracted from global export shipment records or analysis of the route of 
chemical synthesis. The estimated costs were compared with list prices from a 
range of countries where pricing data were available.
RESULTS: Minimum estimated costs of production were US $0.93/day for remdesivir, 
$1.45/day for favipiravir, $0.08/day for hydroxychloroquine, $0.02/day for 
chloroquine, $0.10/day for azithromycin, $0.28/day for lopinavir/ritonavir, 
$0.39/day for sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and $1.09/day for pirfenidone. Costs of 
production ranged between $0.30 and $31 per treatment course (10-28 days). 
Current prices of these drugs were far higher than the costs of production, 
particularly in the US.
CONCLUSIONS: Should repurposed drugs demonstrate efficacy against COVID-19, they 
could be manufactured profitably at very low costs, for much less than current 
list prices. Estimations for the minimum production costs can strengthen price 
negotiations and help ensure affordable access to vital treatment for COVID-19 
at low prices globally.
