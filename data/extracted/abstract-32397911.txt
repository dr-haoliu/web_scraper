At the time of writing this review, severe acute respiratory coronavirus 
syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more than 2,355,853 patients and resulted 
in more than 164,656 deaths worldwide (as of 20 April 2020). This review 
highlights the preventive measures, available clinical therapies and the 
potential of vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2 by taking into consideration 
the strong genetic similarities of the 2003 epidemic SARS-CoV. Recent studies 
are investigating the repurposing of US FDA-approved drugs as there is no 
available vaccine yet with many attempts under clinical evaluation. Several 
antivirals, antimalarials and immunomodulators that have shown activity against 
SARS-CoV and Middle East coronavirus respiratory syndromes are being evaluated. 
In particular, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir, arbidol, tocilizumab 
and bevacizumab have shown promising results. The main aim of this review is to 
provide an overview of this pandemic and where we currently stand.
