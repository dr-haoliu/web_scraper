Background: COVID-19 has several overlapping phases. Treatments to date have 
focused on the late stage of disease in hospital. Yet, the pandemic is by 
propagated by the viral phase in out-patients. The current public health 
strategy relies solely on vaccines to prevent disease.Methods: We searched the 
major national registries, pubmed.org, and the preprint servers for all ongoing, 
completed and published trial results.Results: As of 2/15/2021, we found 111 
publications reporting findings on 14 classes of agents, and 9 vaccines. There 
were 62 randomized controlled studies, the rest retrospective observational 
analyses. Only 21 publications dealt with outpatient care. Remdesivir and high 
titer convalescent plasma have emergency use authorization for hospitalized 
patients in the U.S.A. There is also support for glucocorticoid treatment of the 
COVID-19 respiratory distress syndrome. Monoclonal antibodies are authorized for 
outpatients, but supply is inadequate to treat all at time of diagnosis. 
Favipiravir, ivermectin, and interferons are approved in certain 
countries.Expert Opinion: Vaccines and antibodies are highly antigen specific, 
and new SARS-Cov-2 variants are appearing. We call on public health authorities 
to authorize treatments with known low-risk and possible benefit for outpatients 
in parallel with universal vaccination.
