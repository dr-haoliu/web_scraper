OBJECTIVE: We explored longitudinal trends in sociodemographic characteristics, 
reported symptoms, laboratory findings, pharmacological and non-pharmacological 
treatment, comorbidities, and 30-day in-hospital mortality among hospitalized 
patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients diagnosed with 
COVID-19 in the United States Veterans Health Administration between 03/01/20 
and 08/31/20 and followed until 09/30/20. We focused our analysis on patients 
that were subsequently hospitalized, and categorized them into groups based on 
the month of hospitalization. We summarized our findings through descriptive 
statistics. We used Cuzick's Trend Test to examine any differences in the 
distribution of our study variables across the six months.
RESULTS: During our study period, we identified 43,267 patients with COVID-19. A 
total of 8,240 patients were hospitalized, and 13.1% (N = 1,081) died within 30 
days of admission. Hospitalizations increased over time, but the proportion of 
patients that died consistently declined from 24.8% (N = 221/890) in March to 
8.0% (N = 111/1,396) in August. Patients hospitalized in March compared to 
August were younger on average, mostly black, urban-dwelling, febrile and 
dyspneic. They also had a higher frequency of baseline comorbidities, including 
hypertension and diabetes, and were more likely to present with abnormal 
laboratory findings including low lymphocyte counts and elevated creatinine. 
Lastly, there was a decline from March to August in receipt of mechanical 
ventilation (31.4% to 13.1%) and hydroxychloroquine (55.3% to <1.0%), while 
treatment with dexamethasone (3.7% to 52.4%) and remdesivir (1.1% to 38.9%) 
increased.
CONCLUSION: Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, we observed a trend 
towards decreased disease severity and mortality over time.
