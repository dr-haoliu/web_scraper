Drugs targeting RNA respiratory viruses have resulted in few effective 
therapies, highlighting challenges for antivirals to treat COVID-19. Several 
antivirals are being investigated for symptomatic COVID-19 but no definitive 
data support their clinical use. Remdesivir appears to result in favorable 
outcomes with shortened time to recovery and a modest decrease in mortality for 
hospitalized patients in compassionate use series and some randomized controlled 
trials. Currently, remdesivir is available only from the US government via an 
emergency use authorization process. A randomized controlled trial of 
lopinavir/ritonavir demonstrated no apparent clinical or virologic benefit and 
drug-drug interactions and side effects further limit its utility. Antivirals to 
treat influenza (oseltamivir) have limited activity against SARS-CoV-2, but 
favipiravir and umifenovir, two influenza antivirals available internationally, 
may have distinct viral targets and require further investigation. Antivirals 
with evidence of clinical activity must be studied as treatment and prophylaxis 
for those at high risk for severe COVID-19.
