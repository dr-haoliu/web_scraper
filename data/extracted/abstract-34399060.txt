BACKGROUND: Relatively little is known about the use patterns of potential 
pharmacologic treatments of COVID-19 in the United States.
OBJECTIVE: To use the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a large, 
multicenter, longitudinal cohort, to characterize the use of hydroxychloroquine, 
remdesivir, and dexamethasone, overall as well as across individuals, health 
systems, and time.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: 43 health systems in the United States.
PARTICIPANTS: 137 870 adults hospitalized with COVID-19 between 1 February 2020 
and 28 February 2021.
MEASUREMENTS: Inpatient use of hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, or dexamethasone.
RESULTS: Among 137 870 persons hospitalized with confirmed or suspected 
COVID-19, 8754 (6.3%) received hydroxychloroquine, 29 272 (21.2%) remdesivir, 
and 53 909 (39.1%) dexamethasone during the study period. Since the release of 
results from the RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy) trial in 
mid-June, approximately 78% to 84% of people who have had invasive mechanical 
ventilation have received dexamethasone or other glucocorticoids. The use of 
hydroxychloroquine increased during March 2020, peaking at 42%, and started 
declining by April 2020. By contrast, remdesivir and dexamethasone use gradually 
increased over the study period. Dexamethasone and remdesivir use varied 
substantially across health centers (intraclass correlation coefficient, 14.2% 
for dexamethasone and 84.6% for remdesivir).
LIMITATION: Because most N3C data contributors are academic medical centers, 
findings may not reflect the experience of community hospitals.
CONCLUSION: Dexamethasone, an evidence-based treatment of COVID-19, may be 
underused among persons who are mechanically ventilated. The use of remdesivir 
and dexamethasone varied across health systems, suggesting variation in patient 
case mix, drug access, treatment protocols, and quality of care.
