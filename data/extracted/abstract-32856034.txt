BACKGROUND: As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disseminates throughout the 
United States, a better understanding of the patient characteristics associated 
with hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality in diverse geographic regions is 
essential.
METHODS: Hospital chargemaster data on adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to 
245 hospitals across 38 states between 15 February and 20 April 2020 were 
assessed. The clinical course from admission, through hospitalization, and to 
discharge or death was analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 11 721 patients were included (majority were >60 years of 
age [59.9%] and male [53.4%]). Comorbidities included hypertension (46.7%), 
diabetes (27.8%), cardiovascular disease (18.6%), obesity (16.1%), and chronic 
kidney disease (12.2%). Mechanical ventilation was required by 1967 patients 
(16.8%). Mortality among hospitalized patients was 21.4% and increased to 70.5% 
among those on mechanical ventilation. Male sex, older age, obesity, geographic 
region, and the presence of chronic kidney disease or a preexisting 
cardiovascular disease were associated with increased odds of mechanical 
ventilation. All aforementioned risk factors, with the exception of obesity, 
were associated with increased odds of death (all P values < .001). Many 
patients received investigational medications for treatment of COVID-19, 
including 48 patients on remdesivir and 4232 on hydroxychloroquine.
CONCLUSIONS: This large observational cohort describes the clinical course and 
identifies factors associated with the outcomes of hospitalized patients with 
COVID-19 across the United States. These data can inform strategies to 
prioritize prevention and treatment for this disease.
